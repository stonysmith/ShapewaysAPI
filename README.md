# ShapewaysAPI
Various tools for interacting with the Shapeways API

# Introduction
This is a repository for code to interface with the Shapeways API. My plan is to post interfaces using several different programming languages.

Be warned: very little of the code here will have proper error checking in it at first.  The presumption will be that everything works the first time, and that no error checking is required.
